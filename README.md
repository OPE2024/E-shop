E-commerce website:
Project Overview:
Set up a development environment: Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on
your computer. have a code editor installed, such as Visual Studio Code.
Create a new React project: use the create-react-app command to create a new React project.
This will set up a basic React project with all the necessary files and dependencies.
Integrate Strapi with React: install the Strapi API and connect it to your React project. This can
be done by creating a new Strapi project and then using the Strapi API to fetch data from your
Strapi project and display it in your React app.
Add e-commerce functionality: use React to build the user interface for your e-commerce
website, including product listings, shopping carts, and checkout pages, also use Stripe to
handle payment processing.
Deploy your e-commerce website: deploy it to a hosting platform, such as Heroku or AWS.
Below are the three main tools I will be using for this project:
React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is widely used for creating
single-page applications and mobile applications.
Strapi: Strapi is a free and open-source headless content management system (CMS) that
allows you to easily manage your website's content.
Stripe: Stripe is a payment processing platform that provides a simple and secure way to accept
payments online
